BlockMason offers Credit Protocol (CP) open source within the CP community on the basis of the following license terms governing CP Tokens, which are identical to the License terms and conditions of the CP Token sale of October 2017:

BlockMason grants you and every purchaser and acquirer of CP Tokens a fully-paid-up license, for as long as you hold CP Tokens, to perform transactions on the CP smart contract up to but not exceeding the rate of transactions per hour per CP Token that is determined by the CP smart contract as modified from time to time by BlockMason in its discretion or by BlockMasonâ€™s assignee.  The limiting rate of transactions per hour per CP Token applies also to transactions on any derivative work of CP, and BlockMason allows persons to create and provide such derivative works only on condition that they enable BlockMason to verify the monthly number of transactions performed on their derivative work  and the number of CP tokens they hold.
